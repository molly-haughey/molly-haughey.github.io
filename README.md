  ///////////Installation Instructions
  I designed this site so that somebody with a latent interest in Pokemon could scroll forwards and backwards through some pictures of Pokemon (on the main page) and then visit a link to discover the Pokedex for Ditto. 
  
  To use the carousel on the main page:
  Click "Next" on the bottom of the carousel to move fowards through the images and "Previous" on the top of the carousel to move backwards through the images.
  
  To access the Pokedex:
  1. From the main page, scroll to the bottom navigation bar and click "Pokemon."
  2. And image and info on Ditto will slowly appear automatically (an animation). To access the Pokedex for Ditto, click the button "Generate Pokedex".
 
 ////////////Unsolved Problems
 Resizing the "Generate Pokedex" button. It never became the size I wanted it do be.
